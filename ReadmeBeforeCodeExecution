Prototype User Registration Activity:
Problems you may encounter:
During project building:
- Some nonexistent class related Java runtime exceptions may occur. 
Known exceptions include but limited to the following exceptions: Nullpointer exceptions (Logcat output).

The above may occur sometmes during the POI_Locator app's entire building phase. 
Upon testing each indivual activity class through building them and then running them individually, I found I could still execute at least the prototype user registration activity class correctly. 
Dont know why the Google Maps permissions request dialogue does not appear though.(Will have to look into this and the above problems in my team's testing phase).

Dont know if the rest of my team have encountered any errors and/or exceptions when building and/or excuting their respective parts.
